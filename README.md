# kHz-STABILIZER

kHz-Stabilizer is a complete stabilization solution for pulsed lasers and has sub-micrometer control potential. It introduces a predictive model based on the frequency content 
of the noise profile incident on the camera chip. It uses a digital CMOS camera acquiring at a 1 kHz frame-rate as its control sensor, and is coupled to piezo-electric amplifiers and actuators. The control algorithm includes a sliding DTFT-based predictive calculation in feedback with proportional moving average control to remove sytematic errors (low-frequency drifting). It is least-effective against broad-bandwidth noise (e.g. white noise), and very effective against noise profiles with sparse and sharp peaks in the frequency domain. The stabilization system identifies a discrete first-order system for the piezo-electric actuator amidst noise via algorithmic selection of drive frequencies and use of band-pass filters.
