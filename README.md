# kHz-STABILIZER

kHz-Stabilizer is a complete stabilization solution for pulsed lasers and has sub-micrometer control potential. Coupled to piezo-electric amplifiers and actuators, it uses a digital CMOS camera acquiring at a 1 kHz frame-rate as its sole sensor for feedback. It introduces a predictive model based on the frequency content of the noise profile. This involves a sliding DTFT-based calculation every millisecond in feedback with proportional moving average control to remove sytematic errors (low-frequency drifting). It is least-effective against broad-bandwidth noise (e.g. white noise), and very effective against noise profiles with sparse and sharp peaks in the frequency domain. The stabilization system identifies a discrete first-order system for the piezo-electric actuator amidst noise via algorithmic selection of drive frequencies and use of band-pass filtering. This model is used to identify the commands that correspond to the desired noise correction, which are sent to the actuators. The GUI is built using the Qt framework. Other C++ libraries used include armadillo, FFTW, and NLopt.
